# dw
Walk a directory and output all leaf nodes (files).

I wrote this to help me test another project I was working on. I needed an easy way to recursively `cat` a directory.
After writing this script, it's as easy as typing `cat $(dw)` in BASH.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HousedHorse/dw
$ cd dw
$ sudo make install
```
